# Image Generation using Deep Convolutional GAN

## Overview

This project implements an image generation model using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The goal is to generate images from random noise through a combination of deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Generates realistic images from random noise.
- Utilizes a deep convolutional architecture for improved image quality.
- Includes training scripts and pre-trained models.
- Visualization of generated images during training and tracking using Mlflow.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Result

Since the model only trained for 50 epochs, the result not quite sharp yet, but it has successfully generate cat images
